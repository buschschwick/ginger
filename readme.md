Ginger is a minimal flexbox 12 column grid system named after a cute dog. It doesn't give
you any fancy extras like some other frameworks, but what it does give you is a
solid lightweight grid system to make developing and designing your next site
easy and quick.

## Installing Ginger

There are two ways to install Ginger.

> Note: as of August 2020, bower is no longer supported

1. Clone the repository or download the files to your project
1. Install via npm/yarn using `npm install ginger-grid --save` or `yarn add ginger-grid`

When setting up the `scss` file for your project be sure to include the Ginger
settings file before importing `ginger.scss`. An example `scss` file may look like this:

```scss
// Include Ginger
@import "ginger/settings";
@import "ginger/ginger";
```

It's important to note that you may get a compile error if you're not including
the path to Ginger when compiling your styles.

You can view all the documentation at [gingergrid.com](https://gingergrid.com).
